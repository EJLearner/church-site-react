        <h2>Bible Study</h2>
        <p>
          For our adult community, Bible Study remains one of our primary
          opportunities for spiritual growth. Pastor Yeargin teaches our bible
          study classes; however, other members of our ministerial staff may
          also teach; and classes are offered multiple times throughout the
          week.
        </p>
        <p>
          While the Bible is our principal text, Pastor Yeargin uses additional
          resources to help broaden the lessons and facilitate practical life
          application.
        </p>
        Bible Study Classes Occur:
        <ul>
          <li>Sundays after morning worship</li>
          <li>Tuesdays at noon and at 7:30 pm</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
