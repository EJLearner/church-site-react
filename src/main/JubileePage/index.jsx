      Greetings, church family, friends, Christian brothers and sisters.
      Hallelujah and To God Be the Glory! We are poised to celebrate 50
      triumphant years in history at The City Temple of Baltimore (Baptist). The
      Lord has blessed us to reach this milestone in the life of our church and
      we honor and thank him for his Grace, Mercy, Faith, and guidance that
      brought us this far. Throughout this year of Jubilee, we will recognize,
      honor, and celebrate the historic events in our past and formulate our
      vision for our future.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is an exciting time in the life of our church, a time for reflection
      and forward thinking. We are both grateful for the past and accepting of
      the challenge for the future. Please join us as we journey forward and
      rejoice in what God has done!
    </p>
    <p>Avis Anderson Chair, 50th Anniversary</p>
