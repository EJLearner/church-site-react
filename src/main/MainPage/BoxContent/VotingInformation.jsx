      <p>
        There is no doubt in my mind and soul that this is the most important
        Presidential Election in my lifetime. Never has there been a sitting
        President been involved in tampering with our voting system in order to
        insure his re-election. Therefore, it is imperative that we do
        everything we can to make sure that it does not happen in the 2020
        Presidential Election.
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe the following information can be helpful to all of us as we
        move toward the upcoming election. Hopefully you will take the time to
        read it so that you can be familiar with important information about
        this yearâ€™s Presidential Election.
