          The world needs more than the secret holiness of individual
          inwardness. It needs more than sacred sentiments and good intentions.
          God asks for the heart because He needs the lives. It is by lives. It
          is by lives that the world will be redeemed, by lives that beat in
          concordance with God, by deeds that outbeat the finite charity of the
          human heart.
        </p>
        <p>
          Man’s power of action is less vague than his power of intention. And
          an action has intrinsic meaning; its value to the world is independent
          of what it means to the person performing it. The act of giving food
          to a helpless child is meaningful regardless of whether or not the
          moral intention is present. God asks for the heart, and we must sell
          our answer in terms of deeds.
        </p>
        <p>
          It would be a device of conceit, if not presumption, to insist that
          purity of the heart is the exclusive test of piety. Perfect purity is
          something we rarely know how to obtain or how to retain. No one can
          claim to have purged all the dross even from his finest desire. The
          self is finite, but selfishness is infinite. God asks for the heart,
          but the heart is oppressed with uncertainty in its own twilight. God
          asks for faith, and the heart is not sure of its own faith. It is good
          that there is a dawn of decision for the sight of the heart; deeds to
          objectify faith, definite forms to verify belief.
        </p>
        <p>
          The heart is often a lonely voice in the marketplace of living. Man
          may entertain lofty ideals and behave like the ass that, as the saying
          goes, “carries gold and eats thistles.” The problem of the soul is how
          to live nobly in an animal environment; how to persuade and train the
          tongue and the senses to behave in agreement with the insights of the
          soul.
        </p>
        <p>
          The integrity of life is not exclusively a thing of the heart; it
          implies more than consciousness of the moral law. The innermost
          chamber must be guarded at the uttermost outposts. Religion is not the
          same as spiritualism; what man does in his concrete, physical
          existence is directly relevant to the divine. Spirituality is the
          goal, not the way of man. In this world music is played on physical
          instruments, and to the Jew the mitsvot are the instruments on which
          the holy is carried out. If man were only mind, worship in thought
          would be the form in which to commune with god. But man is body and
          soul, and his goal is so to live that both “his heart and his flesh
          should sing to the living God.”

          Many persons, ordained or not, live in a fairly constant state of
          noise, with their unresolved past and the uncertain present breaking
          in on them. They lack a still center and it is only for such a quiet
          point that we can listen attentively. When I was in my first parish,
          which was located in the middle of the city, a constant stream of
          indigents came through. One came into my office and wanted to tell me
          his story. I sat as if to listen but was deeply troubled inside over
          some issue now long forgotten. I remember I was fiddling with a
          pencil. The man stopped his story, looked at me and said, “Young
          Father, the least you can do is listen.” He was right. There was no
          still center in me.

          Thomas Merton (1915 – 1968), the fascinating Cistercian monk whose
          writings continue to increase in popularity, found the busy life of a
          Trappist very disconcerting. Despite the fact that speaking is
          severely curtailed in a Cistercian monastery, he found the place
          incredibly noisy. For many years he sought permission to live as a
          hermit on the property of the monastery. He needed the quiet that he
          might listen. Too frequently we do not understand the hermit’s
          discipline, a discipline that needs to be ours in spirit, if not in
          fact.
