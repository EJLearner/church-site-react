        “Our Father, give us the faith to believe that it is possible for us to
        live victoriously even in the midst of dangerous opportunity that we
        call crisis. Help us see that there is something better than patient
        endurance or keeping a stiff upper lip, and that whistling in the dark
        is not really bravery. Bless us with the greatness of humility, that we
        may feel no shame in expressing our need of a living God. Forgive the
        pride that causes us to strut about like knights in shining armour when
        we know full well that we are but beggars in tattered rags. Plant a seed
        of faith in us today and nurture it that it may grow. Then, trusting in
        thee may we have the faith that goes singing in the rain, knowing that
        all things work together for good to them that love Thee. Through Jesus
        Christ, our Lord. Amen.”

        “Silence is the way to make solitude a reality. The Desert Faithers
        praise silence as the safest way to God. “I have often repented of
        having spoken,” Arsenius said, “But never of having remained silent.”
        One day Archbishop Theophilus came to the desert to visit Abba Pambo.
        But Abba Pambo did not speak to him. When the brethren finally said to
        Pambo, “Father, say something to the archbishop, so that he may be
        edified,” he replied: “If he is not edified by my silence, he will not
        be edified by my speech.”

        the table of daily life, I seem to hear the echo of Jesus’ words to the
        woman at the well, “If you but knew the gift of God…” Whether God weeps
        at the beauty and potential of our lives at birth or the lost potential
        of graced moments along the way, I hear that voice urging us to claim
        our splendor and our glory. “If you but knew the gift of God…” <br />
        The gift of God is the Divine Indwelling. It comes quietly into your
        frailty at baptism. You become a tabernacle for the Source of Life. When
        you come to understand this old yet often forgotten truth, you will know
        what is meant by the words heaven on earth. This is it! You are
        beginning to live heaven on earth in the Divine Indwelling. You, frail
        earth-creature, having given your frailty over to God, have created a
        place of splendor within the depth of your being, a holy and eternal
        space where you meet God face to face. Cherish this truth. It is costly

        empowers us to act. Everything we do, be it the decisions we make or the
        actions we take during the course of a day, is based on some consciously

        to cause us to want to act on their behalf. One of the things that makes
        me unique is the particular value structure that empowers my life. There
        are elements of this structure that I might hold in common with others,

        “Prayer is the language of Christian community,” writes Henri Nouwen.
        “In prayer the nature of the community becomes visible because in prayer
        we direct ourselves to the one who forms the community. We do not pray
        to each other, but together we pray to God, who calls us and makes us a
        new people.” It is in the act of worship that we experience the gift of
        community at its deepest level. In the eucharistic offering of bread and
        wine, our brokenness and separation are offered in symbolic union with
        the broken body of Christ, and then given back transformed and made
        whole as a sign of that new community brought into being by his
        resurrection. If we are to understand what it means to be
        community-builders, we must do so from this perspective. Ministry is
        given to us by God. It remains authentic only as it is empowered at its
        source, supported and guided by the community of faith, and then shared
        with others. “Make me an instrument of your peace,” prayed St. Francis.
        “Where there is hatred, let me sow love; where there is injury, pardon;
        where there is discord, union.” This is what it means to exercise a
        community-building ministry, to be in the fullest sense, an ambassador
        of reconciliation.”

          “How did our ascetics, fathers, and teachers warm the spirit of prayer
          inwardly and establish themselves firmly in prayer? Their great object
          was to make the heart burn unceasingly towards the Lord alone. God
          claims the heart because within it lies the source of life. Where the
          heart is, there is consciousness, attention, mind; there is the whole
          soul.”

        “God himself must free the man who is unfree and incapable of winning
        his own freedom, must free him for freedom. He can turn “slaves of sin”
        into “slaves of God”, who have been “set free from sin” (Rom. 6:20, 22).
        God does this for the man who believes, whether Jew or Gentile, through
        his eschatological act of salvation in Jesus Christ. In Christ, the new
        free man, God promised and revealed and created the way to a new and
        true freedom. Sinful man thinks he can find freedom by self-confidently
        controlling himself and his own life. But he is warned that he can only
        win freedom by abdicating this control to another – not to men, who
        would reduce him to the rank of a slave, but to God, who will accept him
        as his child. To be able to do what one wants is only the appearance of
        freedom; true freedom is to will what God does.”

          “Pastors also need to take courage and share boldly and tenderly.
          People need the truth. It does them no good to remain ignorant. They
          need the freedom that comes through the grace of simplicity. And if we
          are to bring the whole counsel of God, we must give attention to these
          issues that enslave people so savagely. Martin Luther is reported to
          have said, “If you preach the Gospel in all aspects with the exception
          of the issues which deal specifically with your time you are not
          preaching the Gospel at all.”{' '}

          “Given the contemporary milieu, several dimensions of simplicity seem
          to me to need careful attention in the teaching ministry of the
          Church. We must boldly teach the essential connection between the
          inner and outer aspects of simplicity. We can no longer allow people
          to engage in pious exercises that are divorced from the hard social
          realities of life. Nor can we tolerate a radical social witness that
          is devoid of inward spiritual vitality. Our preaching and teaching
          needs to hold these elements in unity. If our teaching is centered in
          the biblical text, we will find literally hundreds of examples - from
          Abraham to St. John, from the wisdom literature to the apocalyptic
          writings.”

        “It is not what you are nor what you have been that God sees with his
        all-merciful eyes, but what you desire to be. St. Gregory declares that
        “all holy desires heighten in intensity with the delay of fulfillment,
        and desire which fades with delay was never holy desire at all.” For if
        you experience less and less joy when you discover anew the sudden
        presence of great desires you had formerly pursued, your first desire
        was not holy desire. Possibly you felt a natural tendency toward the
        good but this should not be confused with holy desire. St. Augustine
        explains what I mean by holy desire when he says that “The entire life
        of a good Christian is nothing less than holy desire.”

        This manner of action gave us a boundless liberty, and nurtured

        Another important element taking shape in the community we were forming

        “It is impressive to see how prayer opens one’s eyes to nature. Prayer
        makes men contemplative and attentive. In place of manipulating, the man
        who prays stands receptive before the world. He no longer grabs but
        caresses, he no longer bites, but kisses, he no longer examines but
        admires. To this man, as for Merton, nature can show itself completely

        God comes like the sun in the morning – when it is time. <br />
        We must assume an attitude of waiting, accepting the fact that we re
        creatures and not creator. <br />
        We must do this because it is not our right to do anything else; the
        initiative is God’s, not ours. We are able to initiate nothing; we are
        able only to accept. <br />
        If God does not call, no calling takes place. If God does not come,
        there is no history! History is the coming of God to us, and the way in
        which we reply. <br />
        Only God created the heavens and the earth; only God can create history.
        We carry it out through our response, but the inspiration, the design,
        and the strength to carry it out come from him. <br />
        In short, he is what creates, and we creatures are in an act of
        becoming.
