          “When Jesus took the bread, blessed it, broke it and gave it to his
          disciples, he summarized in these gestures his own life. Jesus is
          chosen from all eternity, blessed at his baptism in the Jordan River,
          broken on the cross and given as bread to the world. Being chosen,
          blessed, broken and given is the sacred journey of the Son of God,
          Jesus the Christ.

          When we take bread, bless it, break it and give it with the words,
          “This is the Body of Christ,” we express our commitment to make our
          lives conform to the life of Christ. We too want to live as people
          chosen, blessed, and broken and thus become food for the world.”

        “To pray well I must first find out where I am. Self-knowledge is never
        procured cheaply. To pray well I need to face up to realities about
        myself that I would prefer to ignore: my anxieties, fears, private
        griefs, failures, lovelessness, my utter lack of resources. To accept
        the truth about what I am, as also the truth about other human beings,
        demands courage. If I do not pray well, it is usually because I lack
        that kind of courage.”

        “We have to train ourselves to recognize how we’re giving an “affective
        charge” to an offense, how we are getting energy from mulling over
        someone else’s mistakes. We can build a case with no effort at all. We
        wrap and embellish and by the time our twenty minutes of “prayer” are
        over, we have a complete case. The verdict is in: the other person is
        guilty. And wrong besides. And because the other is wrong, we are right.
        “Scapegoating” is when we displace the issue and project it over there
        instead of owning it here, too. Only the contemplative mind can
        recognize its own complicity and participation in this great mystery of
        evil. The contemplative mind holds the tension and refuses to ease
        itself by projecting evil elsewhere.”

        “Repentance…requires two things: humility and trust. Repentance requires
        the humility involved in the confession that I am a sinner, one whose
        life is not whole and who lacks the power both to find either the
        direction to wholeness or the resources for wholeness on my on.
        Repentance requires trust in a power that can and will ultimately
        sustain and establish me if I let go of myself into that power’s hands.
        Without both trust and humility, repentance is impossible.”

        “Thomas Merton insists that there is no union with God without
        transformation. Paradoxically, the person who has struggled with
        personal transformation and become psychologically stronger is the
        person who can be empty and receptive before God. It is the prepared
        personality that is less resistant to God’s love. This vulnerability is
        an act of strength, since we no longer need to hold tightly to a false
        self that protects us from our inner pain and fears. We are free at
        last. We can surrender to God, who is everywhere and always present, and
        can actively respond as the occasion requires. We have the ease to rest
        in God in whom we have been found.”

        “How often people today cry out in exasperation of despair, “I just
        don’t have enough time!” There is so much to do: earn a living, fulfill
        a vocation, nurture relationships, care for dependents, exercise, clean
        the house. Moreover, we hope to maintain sanity while doing all this,
        and to keep growing as faithful and loving people at the same time. We
        are finite, and the demands seem too great, the time too short… Puritan
        Sabbath keepers agreed that “good Sabbaths make good Christians.” They
        meant that regular, disciplined attention to the spiritual life was
        foundation of faithfulness. Another dimension of the saying opens up if
        we imagine a worshiping community helping one another step off the
        treadmill of work-and-spend and into the circle of glad gratitude for
        the gifts of God. Taken this way, good Sabbaths make good Christians by
        regularly reminding us of God’s creative, liberating, and redeeming
        presence, not only in words but also through a practice we do together
        in response to that presence.”

        “Jesus asked two of John’s disciples (John 1:38) what they were looking
        for and invited them to come and see where and how he lived. The desire
        to know and be near to God has been placed within as an invitation to a
        lifelong quest for companionship with the divine. And yet, from personal
        experience we know that sometimes we look in all the wrong places. These
        disciples of Jesus were invited to continue their search where Jesus was
        and not where he was not. Our directions are certainly as plain as
        theirs are. What are you looking for today and where will your search be
        successful? The quest for God is always successful when carried out
        where God is to be found. Where shall we begin the search? The deep
        inner rooms of our own soul, sacred scriptures, the book of history,
        current events, the lives of the saints, the poor and oppressed seeking
        our compassion, and the creation itself offer places where God has been
        most readily found in the past. Today pay attention to what has your
        undivided attention and follow the clues to a closer walk with God.”
