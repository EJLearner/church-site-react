          The world needs more than the secret holiness of individual
          inwardness. It needs more than sacred sentiments and good intentions.
          God asks for the heart because He needs the lives. It is by lives. It
          is by lives that the world will be redeemed, by lives that beat in
          concordance with God, by deeds that outbeat the finite charity of the
          human heart.
        </p>
        <p>
          Man’s power of action is less vague than his power of intention. And
          an action has intrinsic meaning; its value to the world is independent
          of what it means to the person performing it. The act of giving food
          to a helpless child is meaningful regardless of whether or not the
          moral intention is present. God asks for the heart, and we must sell
          our answer in terms of deeds.
        </p>
        <p>
          It would be a device of conceit, if not presumption, to insist that
          purity of the heart is the exclusive test of piety. Perfect purity is
          something we rarely know how to obtain or how to retain. No one can
          claim to have purged all the dross even from his finest desire. The
          self is finite, but selfishness is infinite. God asks for the heart,
          but the heart is oppressed with uncertainty in its own twilight. God
          asks for faith, and the heart is not sure of its own faith. It is good
          that there is a dawn of decision for the sight of the heart; deeds to
          objectify faith, definite forms to verify belief.
        </p>
        <p>
          The heart is often a lonely voice in the marketplace of living. Man
          may entertain lofty ideals and behave like the ass that, as the saying
          goes, “carries gold and eats thistles.” The problem of the soul is how
          to live nobly in an animal environment; how to persuade and train the
          tongue and the senses to behave in agreement with the insights of the
          soul.
        </p>
        <p>
          The integrity of life is not exclusively a thing of the heart; it
          implies more than consciousness of the moral law. The innermost
          chamber must be guarded at the uttermost outposts. Religion is not the
          same as spiritualism; what man does in his concrete, physical
          existence is directly relevant to the divine. Spirituality is the
          goal, not the way of man. In this world music is played on physical
          instruments, and to the Jew the mitsvot are the instruments on which
          the holy is carried out. If man were only mind, worship in thought
          would be the form in which to commune with god. But man is body and
          soul, and his goal is so to live that both “his heart and his flesh
          should sing to the living God.”

          Many persons, ordained or not, live in a fairly constant state of
          noise, with their unresolved past and the uncertain present breaking
          in on them. They lack a still center and it is only for such a quiet
          point that we can listen attentively. When I was in my first parish,
          which was located in the middle of the city, a constant stream of
          indigents came through. One came into my office and wanted to tell me
          his story. I sat as if to listen but was deeply troubled inside over
          some issue now long forgotten. I remember I was fiddling with a
          pencil. The man stopped his story, looked at me and said, “Young
          Father, the least you can do is listen.” He was right. There was no
          still center in me.

          Thomas Merton (1915 – 1968), the fascinating Cistercian monk whose
          writings continue to increase in popularity, found the busy life of a
          Trappist very disconcerting. Despite the fact that speaking is
          severely curtailed in a Cistercian monastery, he found the place
          incredibly noisy. For many years he sought permission to live as a
          hermit on the property of the monastery. He needed the quiet that he
          might listen. Too frequently we do not understand the hermit’s
          discipline, a discipline that needs to be ours in spirit, if not in
          fact.

        The purpose of God in the history of man was accomplished when Jesus
        breathed his last upon the cross. The cry “It is finished” was not the
        mere gasp of a wornout life; it was not the cry of satisfaction with
        which a career of pain and sorrow is terminated; it was the deliberate
        utterance of a clear consciousness on the part of God’s appointed
        Revealer that now all had been done that could be done to make God known
        to men and to identify him with men. God’s purpose had ever been one and
        indivisible – declared to men in various ways, a hint here, a broad
        light there, now by a gleam of insight in the mind of a prophet, now by
        a deed of heroism in king or leader, through rude symbolic contrivances
        and through the tenderest of human affections and the highest human
        thoughts. God had been making men ever more and more sensible that his
        one purpose was to come closer and closer into fellowship with them, and
        to draw them into a perfect harmony with him. Forgiveness and
        deliverance from sin were provided for them, knowledge of God’s law and
        will, thus they might learn to know and serve him – all theses were
        secured when Jesus cried “It is finished.”

        “Scripture and tradition habitually put the joys of Heaven into the
        scale against the sufferings of earth, and no solution of the problem of
        pain which does not do so can be called a Christian one. We are very shy
        nowadays of even mentioning Heaven. We are afraid of the jeer about “pie
        in the sky,” and of being told that we are trying to “escape” from the
        duty of making a happy world here and now into dreams of a happy world
        elsewhere. But either there is “pie in the sky” or there is not. If
        there is not, then Christianity is false, for this doctrine is woven
        into its whole fabric. If there is, then this truth, like any other,
        must be faced, whether it is useful at political meetings or no. Again,
        we are afraid that Heaven is a bribe, and that if we make it our goal we
        shall no longer be disinterested. It is not so. Heaven offers nothing
        that a mercenary soul can desire. It is safe to tell the pure in heart
        that they shall see God, for only the pure in heart want to. There are
        rewards that do not sully motives. A man’s love for a woman is not
        mercenary because he wants to marry her, nor his love for poetry
        mercenary because he wants to read it, nor his love of exercise less
        disinterested because he wants to run and leap and walk. Love, by
        definition, seeks to enjoy its object.”

        “Jesus in his solidarity with the marginal ones is moved to compassion.
        Compassion constitutes a radical form of criticism, for it announces
        that the hurt is to be taken seriously, that the hurt is not to be
        accepted as normal and natural but is an abnormal and unacceptable
        condition for humanness. In the arrangement of “lawfulness” in Jesus’
        time, as in the ancient empire of Pharaoh, the one unpermitted quality
        of relation was compassion. Empires are never built or maintained on the
        basis of compassion. The norms of law (social control) are never
        accommodated to persons, but persons are accommodated to the norms.
        Otherwise the norms will collapse and with them the whole power
        arrangement. Thus the compassion of Jesus is to be understood not simply
        as a personal emotional reaction but as a public criticism in which he
        dares to act upon his concern against the entire numbness of his social
        context.”

          On this theme, the Bible is clear and direct in both Testaments – God
          loves and cares for the poor. Jesus is said to be perfect. In other
          words, to be imitators of the perfect love and care for the poor and
          hungry, too. “You will know them by their fruits” (Matt. 7:16a RSV) he
          said, and he meant that we are known by our ethical behavior and
          illustrated by life experience.”
