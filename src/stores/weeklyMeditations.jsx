        “Our Father, give us the faith to believe that it is possible for us to
        live victoriously even in the midst of dangerous opportunity that we
        call crisis. Help us see that there is something better than patient
        endurance or keeping a stiff upper lip, and that whistling in the dark
        is not really bravery. Bless us with the greatness of humility, that we
        may feel no shame in expressing our need of a living God. Forgive the
        pride that causes us to strut about like knights in shining armour when
        we know full well that we are but beggars in tattered rags. Plant a seed
        of faith in us today and nurture it that it may grow. Then, trusting in
        thee may we have the faith that goes singing in the rain, knowing that
        all things work together for good to them that love Thee. Through Jesus
        Christ, our Lord. Amen.”

        “Silence is the way to make solitude a reality. The Desert Faithers
        praise silence as the safest way to God. “I have often repented of
        having spoken,” Arsenius said, “But never of having remained silent.”
        One day Archbishop Theophilus came to the desert to visit Abba Pambo.
        But Abba Pambo did not speak to him. When the brethren finally said to
        Pambo, “Father, say something to the archbishop, so that he may be
        edified,” he replied: “If he is not edified by my silence, he will not
        be edified by my speech.”

        “Every time I say no to the birthing and dying that is set before me at
        the table of daily life, I seem to hear the echo of Jesus’ words to the
        woman at the well, “If you but knew the gift of God…” Whether God weeps
        at the beauty and potential of our lives at birth or the lost potential
        of graced moments along the way, I hear that voice urging us to claim
        our splendor and our glory. “If you but knew the gift of God…” <br />
        The gift of God is the Divine Indwelling. It comes quietly into your
        frailty at baptism. You become a tabernacle for the Source of Life. When
        you come to understand this old yet often forgotten truth, you will know
        what is meant by the words heaven on earth. This is it! You are
        beginning to live heaven on earth in the Divine Indwelling. You, frail
        earth-creature, having given your frailty over to God, have created a
        place of splendor within the depth of your being, a holy and eternal
        space where you meet God face to face. Cherish this truth. It is costly
        grace.”

        <b>Every Christian has a vocation.</b> We are called to share in the
        ministry of Jesus Christ <b>in</b> and <b>through</b> the world. In the
        Sacrament of Baptism this call is incarnated, giving both a clear{' '}
        <b>identity</b> in the world and a sense of purpose about what our lives
        are ultimately for. Sharing in the ministry of Jesus Christ involves
        living in the world as an expression of the holiness we see in him – a
        holiness expressed through his compassion, his concern for justice
        (righteousness), and through his healing and reconciling presence in the
        world. The relationship he offers t us – when entered into with
        seriousness – results in those qualities we see in him being expressed
        through us, sometimes even despite ourselves. We cannot, therefore,
        limit this expression to ourselves. We cannot, therefore, limit this
        expression to a particular profession or a particular role or a
        particular job.

        “Values are more than the ideals or moral absolutes to which we aspire.
        A value is an inner construct blending together religious beliefs,
        ethical principles, societal norms and life experiences in a way that
        empowers us to act. Everything we do, be it the decisions we make or the
        actions we take during the course of a day, is based on some consciously
        or unconsciously held value. Values are freely held and important enough
        to cause us to want to act on their behalf. One of the things that makes
        me unique is the particular value structure that empowers my life. There
        are elements of this structure that I might hold in common with others,
        but the particular combination is mine. This means, of course, that
        Christians can agree on certain ethical principles and yet live their
        lives differently. It is our values that create and sustain our
        life-style.”

        “Prayer is the language of Christian community,” writes Henri Nouwen.
        “In prayer the nature of the community becomes visible because in prayer
        we direct ourselves to the one who forms the community. We do not pray
        to each other, but together we pray to God, who calls us and makes us a
        new people.” It is in the act of worship that we experience the gift of
        community at its deepest level. In the eucharistic offering of bread and
        wine, our brokenness and separation are offered in symbolic union with
        the broken body of Christ, and then given back transformed and made
        whole as a sign of that new community brought into being by his
        resurrection. If we are to understand what it means to be
        community-builders, we must do so from this perspective. Ministry is
        given to us by God. It remains authentic only as it is empowered at its
        source, supported and guided by the community of faith, and then shared
        with others. “Make me an instrument of your peace,” prayed St. Francis.
        “Where there is hatred, let me sow love; where there is injury, pardon;
        where there is discord, union.” This is what it means to exercise a
        community-building ministry, to be in the fullest sense, an ambassador
        of reconciliation.”
