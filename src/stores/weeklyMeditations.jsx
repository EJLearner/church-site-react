          “When Jesus took the bread, blessed it, broke it and gave it to his
          disciples, he summarized in these gestures his own life. Jesus is
          chosen from all eternity, blessed at his baptism in the Jordan River,
          broken on the cross and given as bread to the world. Being chosen,
          blessed, broken and given is the sacred journey of the Son of God,
          Jesus the Christ.

          When we take bread, bless it, break it and give it with the words,
          “This is the Body of Christ,” we express our commitment to make our
          lives conform to the life of Christ. We too want to live as people
          chosen, blessed, and broken and thus become food for the world.”

        “To pray well I must first find out where I am. Self-knowledge is never
        procured cheaply. To pray well I need to face up to realities about
        myself that I would prefer to ignore: my anxieties, fears, private
        griefs, failures, lovelessness, my utter lack of resources. To accept
        the truth about what I am, as also the truth about other human beings,
        demands courage. If I do not pray well, it is usually because I lack
        that kind of courage.”

        “We have to train ourselves to recognize how we’re giving an “affective
        charge” to an offense, how we are getting energy from mulling over
        someone else’s mistakes. We can build a case with no effort at all. We
        wrap and embellish and by the time our twenty minutes of “prayer” are
        over, we have a complete case. The verdict is in: the other person is
        guilty. And wrong besides. And because the other is wrong, we are right.
        “Scapegoating” is when we displace the issue and project it over there
        instead of owning it here, too. Only the contemplative mind can
        recognize its own complicity and participation in this great mystery of
        evil. The contemplative mind holds the tension and refuses to ease
        itself by projecting evil elsewhere.”

        “Repentance…requires two things: humility and trust. Repentance requires
        the humility involved in the confession that I am a sinner, one whose
        life is not whole and who lacks the power both to find either the
        direction to wholeness or the resources for wholeness on my on.
        Repentance requires trust in a power that can and will ultimately
        sustain and establish me if I let go of myself into that power’s hands.
        Without both trust and humility, repentance is impossible.”

        “Thomas Merton insists that there is no union with God without
        transformation. Paradoxically, the person who has struggled with
        personal transformation and become psychologically stronger is the
        person who can be empty and receptive before God. It is the prepared
        personality that is less resistant to God’s love. This vulnerability is
        an act of strength, since we no longer need to hold tightly to a false
        self that protects us from our inner pain and fears. We are free at
        last. We can surrender to God, who is everywhere and always present, and
        can actively respond as the occasion requires. We have the ease to rest
        in God in whom we have been found.”

        “To go where healing love is needed, and give it in a way in which it
        can be received, often means acting in the teeth of our own interests ad
        preferences, even religious interests and preferences. Christ risked his
        reputation for holiness by healing on the Sabbath; he touched the
        unclean and dined with the wrong people; he accepted the love and
        companionship of a sinner [the most wonderful of all remedies for the
        wounds of sin]. He loved with God’s love and so went straight to the
        point: What can I do to restore my fellow creature and how?”

          “Joy does not come from positive predictions about the state of the
          world. It does not depend on the ups and downs of the circumstances of
          our lives. Joy is based on the spiritual knowledge that, while the
          world in which we live is shrouded in darkness, God has overcome the
          world. Jesus says it loudly and clearly: ‘In the world you will have

          lies, that God’s love is stronger than death.”
