        “How terribly, then, have the theologians misrepresented God! Nearly all
        of them represent him as a great King on a grand throne, thinking how
        grand he is, and making it the business of his being and the end of his
        universe to keep up his glory, wielding the bolts of a Jupiter against
        them that take his name in vain. They would not allow this, but follow
        out what they say, and it comes much to this. Brothers, have you found
        our king? There he is, kissing little children and saying they are like
        God. There he is at table with the head of a fisherman lying on his
        bosom, and somewhat heavy at heart that even he, the beloved disciple,
        cannot yet understand him well. The simplest peasant who loves his
        children and his sheep were – no, not a truer, for the other is false,

        “On the one hand, no minister can keep his own experience of life hidden
        from those he wants to help. Nor should he want to keep it hidden. While
        a doctor can still be a good doctor even when his private life is
        severely disrupted, no minister can offer service without a constant and
        vital acknowledgment of his own experiences. On the other hand, it would
        be very easy to misuse the concept of the wounded healer by defending a
        form of spiritual exhibitionism. A minister who talks in the pulpit
        about his own personal problems is of no help to his congregation, for
        no suffering human being is helped by someone who tells him that he has
        the same problems. Remarks such as, “Don’t worry because I suffer from
        the same depression, confusion and anxiety as you do,” help no one. This
        spiritual exhibitionism adds little faith to little faith and creates
        narrowmindedness instead of new perspectives. Open wounds stink and do
        no heal. Making one’s own wounds a source of healing, therefore, does
        not call for a sharing of superficial personal pains but for a constant
        willingness to see one’s own pain and suffering as rising from the depth
        of the human condition which all men share.”

        means the end of the old consciousness that brings death on everyone.
        The crucifixion articulates God’s odd freedom, his strange justice, and
        his peculiar power. It is this freedom [read religion of God’s freedom],
        justice [read economics of sharing], and power [read politics of
        justice] which break the power of the old age and bring it to death.
        Without the cross, prophetic imagination will likely be as strident and
        as destructive as that which it criticizes. The cross is the assurance
        that effective prophetic criticism is done not by an outsider but always

        pain of the criticized one.”

        explain the resurrection out of the previously existing reality. The
        resurrection can only be received and affirmed and celebrated as the new
        action of God whose province it is to create new futures for people and
        to let them be amazed in the midst of despair… The resurrection of Jesus
        is not to be understood in good liberal fashion as a spiritual
        development in the church. Nor should it be too quickly handled as an
        oddity in the history of God or as an isolated act of God’s power.
        Rather, it is the ultimate act of prophetic energizing in which a new

        nowadays of even mentioning Heaven. We are afraid of the jeer about “pie
        in the sky,” and of being told that we are trying to “escape” from the
        duty of making a happy world here and now into dreams of a happy world
        elsewhere. But either there is “pie in the sky” or there is not. If
        there is not, then Christianity is false, for this doctrine is woven
        into its whole fabric. If there is, then this truth, like any other,
        must be faced, whether it is useful at political meetings or no. Again,
        we are afraid that Heaven is a bribe, and that if we make it our goal we
        shall no longer be disinterested. It is not so. Heaven offers nothing
        that a mercenary soul can desire. It is safe to tell the pure in heart
        that they shall see God, for only the pure in heart want to. There are
        rewards that do not sully motives. A man’s love for a woman is not

          “Pastors also need to take courage and share boldly and tenderly.
          People need the truth. It does them no good to remain ignorant. They
          need the freedom that comes through the grace of simplicity. And if we
          are to bring the whole counsel of God, we must give attention to these
          issues that enslave people so savagely. Martin Luther is reported to
          have said, “If you preach the Gospel in all aspects with the exception
          of the issues which deal specifically with your time you are not
          preaching the Gospel at all.” Given the contemporary milieu, several
          dimensions of simplicity seem to me to need careful attention in the
          teaching ministry of the Church.
        </p>
        <p>
          We must boldly teach the essential connection between the inner and
          outer aspects of simplicity. We can no longer allow people to engage
          in pious exercises that are divorced from the hard social realities of
          life. Nor can we tolerate a radical social witness that is devoid of
          inward spiritual vitality. Our preaching and teaching needs to hold
          these elements in unity. If our teaching is centered in the biblical
          text, we will find literally hundreds of examples – from Abraham to
          St. John, from the wisdom literature to the apocalyptic writings.”

        broken, the sick, the lonely. He felt, as we so often do not feel, their

        until eventide. Inspire all my thoughts. Pervade all my imaginations.
        Suggest all my decisions. Lodge in my will’s most inward citadel and
        order all my doings. Be with me in my silence and in may speech, in my
        haste and in my leisure, in company and in solitude, in the freshness of
        the morning and in the weariness of the evening; and give me grace at
        all times to rejoice in thy mysterious companionship.”

        there is nothing dearer to the heart that loves. We shall never lack

        “The fire of God, which is his essential being, his love, his creative
        power, is a fire unlike its earthly symbol in this, that it is only at a
        distance it burns – that the farther from him it burns the worse, and
        that when we turn and begin to approach him, the burning begins to
        change to comfort, which comfort will grow to such bliss that the heart
        at length cries out with a gladness no other gladness can reach, “Whom
        have I in heaven but thee? And there is nothing upon earth that I desire
        besides thee!”

        “The love of our neighbor is the love which comes down from God to man.
        It precedes that which rises from men to God. God is longing to come
        down to those in affliction. As soon as a soul is disposed to consent,
        though it were the last, the most miserable, the most deformed of souls,
        God will precipitate himself into it in order, through it, to look at
        and listen to the afflicted. Only as time passes does the soul become
        aware that he is there. But, though it finds no name for him, wherever
        the afflicted are loved for themselves alone, it is God who is present.
        God is not present, even if we invoke him, where the afflicted are
        merely regarded as an occasion for doing good. They may even be loved on
        this account, but then they are in their natural role, the role of
        matter and of things. We have to bring to them in their inert, anonymous
        condition a personal love.”

        “How terribly, then, have the theologians misrepresented God! Nearly all
        of them represent him as a great King on a grand throne, thinking how
        grand he is, and making it the business of his being and the end of his
        universe to keep up his glory, wielding the bolts of a Jupiter against
        them that take his name in vain. They would not allow this, but follow
        out what they say, and it comes much to this. Brothers, have you found
        our king? There he is, kissing little children and saying they are like
        God. There he is at table with the head of a fisherman lying on his
        bosom, and somewhat heavy at heart that even he, the beloved disciple,
        cannot yet understand him well. The simplest peasant who loves his
        children and his sheep were – no, not a truer, for the other is false,
        but – a true type of our God beside that monstrosity of a monarch!”
